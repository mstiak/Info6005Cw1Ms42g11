You can view the manual that comes with the package by typing:

All the files are located in the /usr/share/cw1-6005-ms42g11/ directory.


In this section I will briefly describe the proccess in order to create my package. 

1. Source files were downloaded from 
https://github.com/info6005/6005_cw1_2012. 

2.I created a new directory for these files and i typed dh_make –e pp6g11@soton.ac.uk –s ‐‐native ‐‐indep 
in order to create the required directory hierarchy. 
3.Then i modified the following files under the debian folder: 
I.
Control 
II.
Copyright 
III.
Changelog 
Also i created the cw1-6005-ms42g11.install where i wrote the paths where the index.php, rss_php.php, feeds.conf and news files will be stored after the instalation.  
 
4.The package comes with a man page. The user therefore, can type man news and 
see the man pages of the package. To do that I created the cw1-6005-ms42g11.manpages file that points to the news.1 script where the man pages are. 
5. Finally, in the same directory I typed fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage so as to create the package.
